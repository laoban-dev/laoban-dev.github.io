| `laoban admin newpackage <directory>`            | the specified directory is created if needed and turned into a `package`.

| `laoban admin newpackage`                        | the current directory is turned into a `package`. Options can be used to control the template and the package nameã€‚ Or you can just inspect and edit the `package.details.json` file afterwards (and run `laoban update` after editing) | 
| `laoban admin newpackage  -p <packageName>`      | the current directory is turned into a `package`. The name of the package is set to `<packageName>`                                                                                                                                     |
| `laoban admin newpackage  --template <template>` | the current directory is turned into a `package`. The template of the package is set to `<template>`                                                                                                                                    |

* If the `package.details.json` already exists (i.e. it is already a new package) then you will need to add `--force` to
  overwrite it.
* If the template you want to use isn't in the list give by `laoban admin templates` then you need to modify
  the `laoban.json` file to add it

# Changing a dependency in a template

For example the version of typescript or the version of react

* Change the `package.json` in one package that uses the template: set the dependency to the version you want
* `laoban admin updateTemplate` running in the directory of the package will update the template with the new dependency
* `laoban update` will be needed afterwards to update the packages that use the template

# Adding dependencies to all packages using a specific template

* If the template is already in the local filesystem (look in the `templates` directory) then go
  edit the package.json in there. Note that the package.json is typically tiny only including 'extras'.
* If the template is not already in there then you need to add it first the instructions above
  in `Changing a dependency in a template`

# Make a new template from scratch

Usually we want to extend a template (for example we might just want to update a dependency as above)

* `laoban admin newtemplate` will turn the current package into a template (options can be used to change the name etc)
* Go to the created template directory and delete the files you don't want
* `laoban admin makeintotemplate` executed in the created template directory will update the `.template.json`
