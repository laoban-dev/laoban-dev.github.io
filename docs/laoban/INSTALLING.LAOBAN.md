
## Install `laoban`

Laoban requires npm and node to operate. 

It is typically installed by `npm t -g @laoban/admin@latest`.

It does require privileges to do this as it is adding an executable. I typically
run this command with either `sudo` on linux, or as administrator on Windows.

## Check `laoban is installed`

At the command line
```shell
laoban --version
```
